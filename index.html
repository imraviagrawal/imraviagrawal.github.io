                                <p style='font-size:100%'>
                                    Objective: During conditional automated driving, a transition from the automated driving suite to manual control requires the driver to take over control at a moment’s notice. Thus, it is critical that a driver be made situationally aware as quickly as possible in those conditions where he or she may not be paying full attention. Recent research suggests that specific cues about upcoming hazards (e.g., “crosswalk ahead”) can increase the drivers’ situation awareness during these safety-critical take-over situations when compared with a general cue (“take over control”). The current study examines whether this increased situation awareness which occurs as a result of more specific cues translates into improved hazard mitigation performance within the same limited time window.
<p  </p>Method: Fifty-seven drivers were randomly assigned to one of five between-subjects conditions (one control condition and four experimental auditory cue conditions) that varied in the specificity of information provided about an upcoming hazard. The four experimental conditions included a period of conditional automated driving where the driver was engaged in a driving-irrelevant task and looked away from the forward roadway prior to a take-over request. Drivers in the fifth condition had no cue and drove manually throughout. The same six simulator scenarios were used in all five conditions to evaluate how well the driver mitigated a hazard.  The average velocity, standard deviation of velocity, and average absolute acceleration were recorded along with the glance behaviors of drivers.

<p  </p>Results: In general, during the 4s prior to a latent hazard (following the alerting cues in the automated driving conditions), the more likely a driver was to glance towards a latent hazard the more likely the driver was to reduce his or her speed.  Moreover, analyses focusing solely on hazard mitigation behavior revealed patterns that mirrored the glance behavior results. Specifically, drivers that were presented with cues that described the environments in which hazards were likely to occur were more likely to demonstrate vehicle behaviors that were consistent with speed reductions (lower velocity, higher speed variability, and higher absolute acceleration) than were drivers who were presented general cues or cues about the identity of the upcoming hazards.
Conclusion: Even in as little as 4s prior to a potential hazard, cues that inform the driver of the environment in which the hazard is likely to occur increase the likelihood that the driver mitigates the crash compared with drivers who are provided general information or threat identity information.

                                    Young drivers are overrepresented in motor-vehicle crashes compared to experienced drivers. 3 Research shows that the young drivers are generally clueless, not careless, failing to anticipate and 4 mitigate latent hazards. There are several error-feedback training interventions that emphasize the 5 teaching of latent hazard anticipation skills (e.g., RAPT) and a few that emphasize both the 6 teaching of hazard anticipation and hazard mitigation skills (e.g., ACCEL). In the current study, a 7 virtual reality, headset-based latent hazard anticipation and mitigation training program (V-RAPT) 8 was developed on a head-mounted display (Oculus Rift). The headset provides the participant with 9 100-degree wide field of view of six high-risk driving scenarios, the view changing appropriately 10 as the participant rotates his or her head. Thirty-six young drivers were exposed to one of three 11 training programs – V-RAPT, RAPT and placebo – and then evaluated on a driving simulator. 12 Eye movement and vehicle data were collected throughout the simulator evaluation. The drives 13 included the six scenarios used in training and four other scenarios dissimilar to the ones used in 14 training, but previously validated as measures of hazard anticipation. The drivers trained on V-15 RAPT were found to anticipate a significantly greater proportion (86.25%) of latent hazards than 16 the RAPT (62.36%) and placebo (30.97%) trained drivers. The V-RAPT trained drivers were also 17 found to be better at mitigating potential threats. The virtual reality, headset-based training 18 program holds out the promise of improving the drivers’ ability to anticipate and mitigate latent 19 threats and thereby reduce crashes.

									The crash rate for young novice drivers is at least eight times higher than that of their experienced counterparts.
									Literature shows that the young novice drivers are not careless drivers but they are clueless drivers’ - clueless

									Twenty-four participants in three experiment groups were trained on one of 3 training programs- VRAPT, RAPT and Control,
									and were evaluated on a driving simulator. Eye movements were collected throughout the experiment. The simulator
									evaluation drives included six near-transfer scenarios used in the training and four far-transfer scenarios not

									found to anticipate a significantly greater proportion (86.25%) of the potential latent hazards as compared to the RAPT

								<strong>Abstract</strong>
								<p style='font-size:100%'>
								 Forward roadway collision warning systems can reduce rear-end
collisions, among other unsafe behaviors. Previous studies have shown that young
drivers fail to scan adequately for latent hazards. The current driving simulator
study investigates the effect of visual collision warning messages on drivers’ hazard
anticipation ability, when presented either 2s, 3s or 4s in advance of a potential
threat. This experiment examined the latent hazard anticipation behavior of fortyeight
young drivers aged 18-25 across eight unique scenarios both, in the presence,
and absence of visual collision warning alerts. The analysis of glance data captured
using an eye tracker, show that visual warning messages significantly increased the
proportion of latent hazards anticipated regardless of hazard type (pedestrian or
vehicle). The 2s warning duration was found to statistically have the same effect on
hazard anticipation compared to the 3s and 4s warning thresholds. The study has
potential implications for the effective design of forward collision warning systems.

								<strong>Abstract</strong>
								<p style='font-size:100%'>  Newly licensed teenage drivers experience a higher risk of crashing compared to other
age cohorts. Literature reveals that novice drivers exhibit poor hazard mitigation skills. The current
study assesses the effectiveness of a training program at improving novice divers’ hazard
mitigation and speed selection behaviors on curves. In this study, drivers are randomly assigned
to two training cohorts (ACT and placebo), and were exposed to 2 different scenarios of interest,
one scenario contained a moderate curve left and the other included a tightening curve right. ACT
trained drivers made more glances to the far extent of the curve, than the placebo-trained drivers.
ACT (Anticipate, Control, and Terminate) trained drivers were also significantly more likely to
slow to the target speed before the curve, when compared to the placebo trained drivers. The results
indicate the effectiveness of ACT as a countermeasure, at training novice drivers to select better
glancing and speed management strategies.

								<strong>Abstract</strong>
								<p style='font-size:100%'> From previous experiments, we know that control must be transferred to the driver in a Level 3 vehicle at least 8s before the driver passes a latent hazard, for the driver to be as aware of the latent hazard as the driver is when glancing continuously on the forward roadway. In these experiments, the driving environment remained consistent throughout the time the ADS was engaged, and immediately after control was transferred to the driver. Considering the fact that drivers expect different categories of hazards in different driving environments, a transition to a different environment while the ADS is engaged may impair a driver’s ability to both achieve situation awareness and successfully mitigate hazards. The current experiment examined if 8s was enough time for drivers to achieve situation awareness and appropriately mitigate hazards when the roadway environment changes while the driver is engaged in a secondary activity which takes his or her eyes away from the forward roadway. Drivers’ eye movements and vehicle metrics were recorded as they completed one of three conditions in a driving simulator: an automation condition where the driving environment remained consistent throughout; an automation condition that contained some transitions to a new environment while the driver engaged the ADS; and a manual driving condition that also contained the same transitions as the latter automation condition. The results suggest that even 8s is not enough time for drivers to achieve situation awareness and mitigate hazards when the hazards are unexpected. </p>

								<strong>Abstract</strong>
								<p style='font-size:100%'> Typically, drivers in a Level 3 automation environment need at least 8s following a manual take-over request to achieve appropriate levels of situation awareness.  Studies that have derived this time estimate use general audio alerts that suggest a transfer of control from the automation to the driver might be required.  The current experiment examined if improvements in younger drivers’ situation awareness might be observed in as little as 4s prior to when a latent hazard might materialize and a transfer of control occurs if more specific audio alerts are used.  Younger drivers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 between-subjects cue conditions¬: 1) a general cue condition, 2) a condition that described the risky feature(s) of the roadway and the location of those features, 3) a condition that contained information regarding the actual identity of the threat and the required behavior, 4) a combination cue condition (both environment and threat cue).  Eye-movements were recorded as drivers completed six scenarios in a simulated automated driving experiment.  The results showed that audio cues that contained information regarding risky roadway features increased the detection of latent hazards by almost 40% compared to when a general cue or a threat cue was used.  Performance with the combined cue was no better than performance with the environment cue.  The environment cue gives drivers the critical seconds needed to mitigate a potential crash.   Results are informative regarding which types of alerts to use to inform drivers of upcoming hazards.  </p>

								<strong>Abstract</strong>
								<p style='font-size:100%'> The failure to anticipate latent hazards (hazards that have not materialized) is a major cause for
crashes among teen drivers, due both to their lack of experience and to their distraction while driving. Several training programs that have been developed to improve drivers’ anticipation skills have proven effective immediately after training, both on driving simulators and on the open road. The current study reports on an on-road longitudinal evaluation of the longer-term effectiveness of an
iPad-based training program, the Engaged Driver Training System (EDTS), at improving novice
drivers’ latent hazard anticipation skills, initially a week after training (EDTS or placebo) and again
seven months after training. Seven months after training, the placebo group’s hazard anticipation
performance was found to have improved to that observed from the EDTS-trained teens a week after
training. This suggests that the EDTS program has immediate benefits to novice drivers in that it can accelerate their learning of hazard anticipation skills, skills that typically take at least six months of exposure to regular driving to develop. Overall, the EDTS-trained teens anticipated a greater
proportion of hazards compared to the placebo group in the near term and far-term, though the far
term differences were modest and not statistically significant. The study also examined the impact of
driving exposure (miles driven) in the period following training on teen drivers’ hazard anticipation
skills and found only a mild, direct correlation between driving exposure and growth in hazard
anticipation skills within both the EDTS and placebo groups.
